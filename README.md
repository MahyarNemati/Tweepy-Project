# Tweepy-Project
Tweepy project was developed for Ministry Of Transportation for the purpose of predicting future accidents of major Ontario highways by collecting data from many different sources and learning from all the data. The extracted information was then sent to an operator to take precautionary steps to avoid the accidents.
